import random

random_interger = random.randint(1,10) # give an output of a range of random integers between the range sepecified 
print(random_interger)                 # and inlcusive of the integers selected

random_float = random.random() # give an output between 0 and 1 but not including 1
print(random_float)

# How to crate a random number between 0 and above 1
